	<center><h1>Early Life</h1>
		<div class="a"><p>Travis Scott is the stage name of Jacques Webster, a Houston-born hip-hop artist and producer.</p>
		<p>Jacques grew up in a suburb of Houston and began making music as a teenager.</p>
		<p>While his parents were giving him money for school, he was spending it on instruments and enhancing his studio.</p>
		<p>When his parents found out, they got extremely mad, which caused Travis to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles with his
		best friend, whose also a producer, Chase B.</p>
        <p>After dropping out of college, Scott moved to Los Angeles and began recording music on his own. He met T.I. and eventually Kanye West.
		Scott was hired as an in-house producer for GOOD Music, and appeared on the label's Cruel Summer compilation in 2012.
		Scott's debut, Owl Pharaoh, was originally scheduled to be released as a free mixtape in 2012, but as his profile grew
	    (including a placement in XXL Magazine's Freshman Class of 2013), and due to sample clearance issues, the album wasn't released until May of 2013. 
	<center><h1>Rise To Fame</h1>
	<p>The buildup to Scott's first proper studio album involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles "Don't Play" and "Mamacita," and the March 2015 U.S.
	Rodeo Tour, for which Scott headlined, supported by Young Thug and Metro Boomin. Several of the dates sold out. During the same month, Rihanna's Scott-produced hit single "B*tch Better Have My Money" was released.
    "3500" and "Antidote" were released ahead of Rodeo, Scott's second full-length, which followed in September on Grand Hustle/Epic and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.
	Toward the end of the year, "Antidote" peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 and became Scott's first platinum single.</p>
